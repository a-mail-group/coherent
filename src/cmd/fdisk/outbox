Subject: fdisk

Revised source and compiled object in mwc!~/steve/fdisk[.c]
by the time you see this, uucp willing.

Hal,

I found the fdisk.c in $uupub on the gateway, thanks.
It did include several differences from the source I found previously
in /usr/hal/fdisk.gtz.

The new one still did not compile, drive_info() was redeclared,
duplicating a declaration in <scsiwork.h> in my header suite,
have your headers changed?  I changed drive_info -> driveinfo to compile it.

Added missing (void) in the ANSI prototype parameter list of print_ptable().

The code supplied in your mail was identical to the code in fdisk.c from
the gateway, apparently you had fixed this already?  If not, please advise.

Please diff and eyeball the changes, thanks.

John,

The changes are a shot in the dark with no test bed here, please let me
and hal know what you find.  Thanks!

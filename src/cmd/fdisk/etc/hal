By now, you should have fdisk.tgz from /usr/hal on the gateway.

Here is a clarification (?) of the startup problems:

1.  During installation from the boot floppy, hard disk device drivers
    are configured using /conf/kpatch and the patch driver.  *All*
    such settings must be propagated to secondary (using /conf/patch)
    and tertiary (using /cohtune_ent or equivalent) kernels, and there
    were several omissions in earlier releases.

2.  For most older BIOSes, hard disk drive parameters used by COH for
    *bootable* partitions must agree exactly with the BIOS on number of
    heads and sectors per track, but may have a differing number of
    cylinders as long as 1) the number of cylinders specified in the
    BIOS does not exceed the drive capacity, and 2) the highest cylinder
    number in the bootable partition does not exceed the last cylinder
    specified in BIOS.  This principle applies to IDE and SCSI drives.

3.  For non-bootable partitions, and (maybe?) with a few new BIOSes with
    bootable partitions, drive parameters do not matter except for
    compatibility with fdisk programs from other OS's, since partition
    start and end are redundandtly encoded as block numbers.

BIOS parameters are available using "info" at the COH boot prompt.
Physical drive parameters are available using SCSI Mode Sense, and on
newer IDE drives using a similar command.

What a pain.

It no longer is appropriate to simply say we are going to modify a partition
table entry, go with it or abort installation, the way older fdisks operated.
We need more flexibility, in order to anticipate situations that we cannot
test at MWC.  We need to make fdisk more flexible, and more informative
about the choices it offers and the actions it is taking.

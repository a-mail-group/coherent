Subject: [nt]roff, fwtable bits

Posted new nroff and troff bits V4.1.2 to mwc!~/steve/ and to lepanto!~/,
as [nt]roff.gz.

At fred's request, ".sy whatever" now passes "whatever" to the system
and number register "$$" contains the current process id.
These are not referenced in Emerson & Paulsell.

hal: these should replace the distribution verions of [nt]roff,
unless you hear otherwise from fred.

troff source change log begun 5/24/92

Sun May 17 09:40:24 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.24.
getf.c
		Added test for bogus names for special characters, etc.
		after fwb typed font escape as part of special character name.

Mon May 25 11:23:42 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.25.
req2.c
		Removed debugging printf() left in by accident, oops...

Wed May 27 23:39:24 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.26.
fonts.c
fonts.h
fwtable.c
fwtable.h
fwt_TFM.c
fwt_PS.c
		Changed int to short in font width table processor and
		reader, so that compilation under COH386 produces bits
		which work as expected with the font width tables.

Thu May 28 15:53:49 1992 PDT
main.c
		Print detailed usage message on illegal arg error
		or if new option -? is specified.

Wed Jun  3 23:35:29 1992 PDT
roff.h
		Bumped VERSION to 3.2.26.
		Changed ABFSIZE from 128 to 256, after user complained
		that it was too small.
request.c
		Corrected bug in array bound check which caused troff
		to core dump on arg string of precisely ABFSIZE characters.

Thu Aug  6 08:35:23 1992 PDT
main.c
		V3.2.27: fixed temp file name code which wrote on
		quoted string template, which causes core dump under COH4.0.

Tue Jan 26 16:20:51 1993 PST
roff.h
		V4.0.1.
fwtable.h
		Deleted unused bogus definition "extern long fseek();",
		defined correctly (as int fseek()) in new <stdio.h>.
req1.c
		Changed req_cu() to just do a .ul.
		This is somewhat wrong,
		.cu is supposed to underline spaces as well as words,
		but it is much better than the way it worked before.
req2.c
		Changed req_ul() to handle ".ul 0" correctly.

Wed Feb  3 17:44:05 1993 PST
process.c
		V4.0.2: changed local horizontal motion default unit
		from 'u' to 'm'.  User Andrew Houghton reported that "\h'-1'"
		did not backspace; he expected the implicit unit to
		be ems, as in Unix.

Thu Feb  4 09:54:32 1993 PST
main.c
		V4.0.3: fixed tempfile code to call mktemp() like it used to.

Mon Mar  1 08:48:19 1993 PST
main.c
		V4.0.4: in main(), fixed arg processing to ignore tempfile
		arg after "-f".

Fri Mar  5 15:24:13 1993 PST
process.c
		V4.0.5: Deleted unnecessary "#include <ascii.h>".
req2.c
		Changed "#include <ascii.h>" to "#include <sys/ascii.h>".
		In req_tl(), set font to "R".  Previously, .tl at the
		start of a file caused troff to core dump.

Tue Mar 30 14:45:56 1993 PST
fwtable.h
fwt_TFM.c
		fwtable V1.4: changed "getint();" to "getword();" and
		int -> short in several places for COH386.  Added verbose
		usage() message.  Deleted debugging output.

Wed Mar 31 12:14:41 1993 PST
fwt_TFM.c
		fwtable V1.5: corrected bug in writing slant value word
		which led to incorrect escape sequence for italic fonts.

Wed Apr  7 17:49:09 1993 PDT
main.c
		V4.0.6: at fwb's request, modified leave() to print page
		eject even for nonzero exit status; previously, it ejected
		the current page on success, but not on fatal errors.

Fri Apr 23 14:18:10 1993 PDT
main.c
		V4.0.7: changed exit status for usage() from 1 to 2,
		allowing leave() to avoid core dumping as it exits.

Thu Sep  2 17:32:13 1993 CDT
roff.h
main.c
req2.c
		V4.0.8: minor hacks to allow compilation under current headers.

Mon Dec 13 16:51:20 1993 PST
misc.c
		Changed <access.h> reference to <unistd.h> to allow compilation
		with current headers.

Wed Jun 15 14:57:59 1994 PDT
fwtable.c
		fwtable V1.7:  in read_header(), if the given face index is
		larger than NFACES, the old source sprintf'ed into a
		blank string, causing a core dump under i386 COHERENT.
		Added a line to allocate space accordingly instead.

Wed Jun 15 15:16:38 1994 PDT
getf.c
		V4.0.9: In scanoptdel(), added missing NUL-terminator to arg
		string.  This fixes a bug in '\s0' reported by Gabor Zehemsky.

Thu Jul  7 15:49:32 1994 PDT
tty.c
		V4.1.0: Changed vertical resolution computations to not
		use half-line motions HLF and HRLF, as requested by fred.
		Still uses escape sequences LF and RLF in some circumstances.
		Added rambling comment about print model.

Thu Sep 15 00:13:48 1994 PDT
req1.c
		V4.1.1: At fred's request, changed req_ft so that ".ft"
		with no arg has the effect of ".ft P".

Fri Oct 28 09:32:04 1994 PDT
extern.c
reg.h
main.c
		V4.1.2: Added predefined number register "$$" (REG nrddreg)
		containing current process id, as requested by fred.
req2.c
request.h
table.c
		Added request ".sy" (system) as requested by fred;
		it just passes a command line to system.

Sat Apr 22 13:48:27 1995 PDT
roff.h
		V4.1.3: changes for Linux port.
fwtable.c
misc.c
		Replaced "%r" printf() formats with vfprintf() calls.
process.c
		Added cast to avoid gcc warning about assignment
		of differing pointer types.
Makefile
		Added $(SRC) macros to allow position-independent make
		in object directory on system which does not support SRCPATH.
main.c
		Changed tempfile freopen() mode from "rwb" to ANSI form "w+b".
		Added missing #include <unistd.h> to get R_OK.
misc.c
		In lib_file(), deleted bogus "register" on auto array
		declaration.  Added #include <stdlib.h> and deleted explicit
		calloc() declaration.  Changed conditionalization for
		memok() call.
fonts.c
fwtable.c
fwtable.h
fwt_TFM.c
		Minor changes to eliminate gcc noise.
include/canon.h
include/path.h
lib/path.c
		Added COHERENT system headers and library file
		to facilitate porting.

Mon Apr 24 10:21:31 PDT 1995
roff.h
		V4.1.4: changes for Sparc port.  Added index() definition.
fwt_TFM.c
		Added SEEK_SET definition to avoid Sparc <stdio.h> misfeature.
fonts.c
		Corrected canint(s) to canshort(s).

Wed Apr 26 06:59:13 PDT 1995
Makefile
include/canon.h
lib/_canon.c
		Modified to do appropriate canonicalization for Sparc.
fonts.c
main.c
misc.c
		Added new functionality to allow roff libraries and macros
		in local directories.  The environmental variables
		ROFF_LIBPATH and ROFF_LIB, if found, now specify a macro
		library path and the location of the /usr/lib/roff files.

Tue May 16 23:51:21 1995 PDT
output.c
		V4.1.5: fixed Linux ".lf R font.fwt 9" bug reported by Fred.
		The dev_pz() declaration in output.c said "char size"
		but meant "char *size".  This caused Linux troff to fail,
		dunno why COHERENT version ever worked.

Fri Oct 13 12:35:52 PDT 1995
env.h
		V4.1.6: bumped LINSIZE; Gnu cpp.1 man page needed larger value.

Sat Jun  3 17:31:35 2000 PDT
		V4.1.7: Changed __sparc__ -> sparc, __STDC__ -> defined(__STDC__)
		for Solaris compilation.

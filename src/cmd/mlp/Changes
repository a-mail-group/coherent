MLP change log begun 8/16/94

Tue Aug 16 17:36:08 1994 PDT
Makefile
		Revised to permit make in object directory.
header.h
		Renamed to mlp.h.
mlp.h
lp.c
lpsched.c
lpstat.c
spooler.c
		Began stylistic cleanup, moving extern declarations to mlp.h.
		In lp.c, fixed incorrect progname assignment.
		In lpstat.c/_delete_destination, fixed close(fp) -> fclose(fp)
		twice.  In spooler.c/log(), fixed close(fp) -> fclose(fp).
		Changed malloc() and calloc() calls to xalloc() to check
		error condition.  Implemented controls() and status() as
		macros rather than functions.

Wed Aug 17 15:31:39 1994 PDT
mlp.h
lp.c
lpsched.c
lpstat.c
spooler.c
		Continue stylistic cleanup: define manifest constants,
		change constant lists to enumerations.  In MLP_lock(),
		add O_CREAT flag to create nonexistent locks.
		Deleted ftok(), now in system.

Thu Aug 18 13:08:49 1994 PDT
lp.c
lpsched.c
lpstat.c
spooler.c
		Fixed bug in MLP_unlock(): removing the lock file allowed
		multiple processes to think they owned the same lock.
		Moved lock files from /usr/spool/mlp/queue/LCK..[0123]
		to /usr/spool/mlp/LCK..[0123] for benefit of lpstat.
		Fixed stat() call bug in roll_log() and call it from main().
		Add exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) at end of main() in each program.

Fri Aug 19 15:02:21 1994 PDT
lp.c
		Added exit status to shutdown_spooler().  Massaged messages.
lpsched.c
		Removed bogus fork() in write_request(), not necessary.
		Moved SIGHUP setting to main() for benefit of mail.
spooler.c
		Rewrote unpadd() more rationally.

Sat Aug 20 23:02:23 1994 PDT
*.[ch]
		Reformatted Blatchey's atrocious spacing (was three space
		indentation per tab), at expense of blowing diffs against old
		sources out of the water, oh well...  Numerous other small
		corrections in passing.

Wed Aug 24 21:46:10 1994 PDT
mlp.h
lp.c
lpstat.c
spooler.c
		Rewrote status() and controls() macros calling parameters()
		to [gs]etstatus() and [gs]etcontrol(), and added P_* argument
		to allow locking sequence numbers in get_seq_num();
		previously, repeated "lp *.c &" would reuse some sequence
		numbers, so some files would not get printed.
lpsched.c
		Cleaned up numerous error messages.  Added additional fork()
		in main(), cf. Stevens reference.  Added "signalled" to wakeup()
		to avoid sleeping excessively in main loop calling despool().
spooler.c
		Added loop in MLP_lock() to retry if lockf() fails with EINTR.

Thu Aug 25 10:31:57 1994 PDT
spooler.c
		Replaced sort in queuelist() with qsort(), make its realloc()
		reasonably efficient.  Conditionalized out ".tmp" code,
		believed by me to be wrongheaded.

Thu Aug 25 14:42:16 1994 PDT
lp.c
		Fixed local print.

Fri Aug 26 15:46:39 1994 PDT
*.c
		Added usage() messages after fred's prodding.

Tue Sep 13 13:21:48 1994 PDT
spooler.c
		In MLP_unlock(), suppress error message if MLP_lock() failed
		to open fd successfully, as error message for that is enough.
mlp.h
		Added VERSION, initially V1.0.
lp.c
		Added -V option to print version number.
lpsched.c
		Added -V option to print version number.
		Cleaned up lpstat output.
lpstat.c
		Added -V option to print version number.
		Invocation as "route" previously fell through to lpstat
		usage message after 8/26/94 change, now corrected in main().
		Cleaned up lpstat output.

Wed Sep 14 10:18:54 1994 PDT
mlp.h
lp.c
lpstat.c
spooler.c
		V1.1: Replaced getlogin() calls with get_username().
		Replaced system("review ...") for "display" printer with "more".

Thu Sep 22 09:31:51 1994 PDT
lpsched.c
		V1.2: At fred's request, added description as fourth arg to
		backend script.  Backend script args are now request number,
		user, copies, and description.
		Reset SIGCLD to SIG_DFL when sending mail, else mail complains.
		Improved message printed when printer device cannot be opened.
spooler.c
		Reset SIGCLD to SIG_DFL when sending mail, else mail complains.

Thu Sep 29 12:44:11 1994 PDT
mlp.h
		V1.3: at jrd's request, nonexistent status file is now created
		rather than causing fatal error.

Wed Oct  5 09:52:12 1994 PDT
Makefile
		Delete hpfilter, no longer shipped.

Fri Oct 14 10:19:47 1994 PDT
lp.c
		V1.4: at Seth Giles' request, made "reprint" with no args work.

Mon Oct 17 09:11:50 1994 PDT
lp.c
		V1.5: at jrd's suggestion, added do_i_own_it call to
		reprint_request(), so that the user's last spooled job
		(rather than any user's last spooled job) gets reprinted.
lpsched.c
		In despool_file(), changed sample description comment and
		subscripts in curr_desc[] references below to reflect reality.
lpstat.c
		In cancel_all() and cancel_requests(),
		added missing arg to do_i_own_it() call.
spooler.c
		In kill_printing_request(), corrected do_i_own_it() arg
		from int to char *.

Mon Nov  7 16:17:02 1994 PST
lp.c
		V1.6: in spool_output, changed to write e.g. file
		/usr/spool/mlp/R* rather than /usr/spool/mlp/queue/R*,
		then rename /usr/spool/mlp/R* to /usr/spool/mlp/queue/R*
		when done.  Previously, lp of stdin would create
		/usr/spool/mlp/queue/R* and the scheduler would despool it
		before the user closed stdin.

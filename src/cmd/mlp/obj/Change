Subject: MLP bits V1.6

Newer MLP bits uploaded to mwc!~/steve/mlpbin.taz and lepanto!~/mlpbin.taz.

A fax from Tecor in Greece, forwarded to my by jrd, pointed out that
"lp" command which reads input from stdin creates a queued job
/usr/spool/mlp/queue/R*, but the MLP scheduler lpsched finds it and
despools it before the standard input finishes providing input.  For example,
	lp
	<wait a bit>
	stuff
	<Ctrl-D>
never prints "stuff", because the scheduler despools the job before you
provide the input.  Now fixed, by writing the control file in
/usr/spool/mlp/R* initially and renaming it as /usr/spool/mlp/queue/R*
only when done.

COHERENT to-do list.

Projects.
Floppy tape formatting.
Floppy tape volume management, e.g. something wrapped around gtar
for multiple archives on a single tape.
boot from b: (new BIOSES allow this)
stop locking out interrupts for so long in vt*kb.c when switching sessions.
-- gnu stuff, as per udo --
OK, r10 includes my new port of gzip 1.2.4, but the following
programs are still missing and everybody needs them:
zcmp zdiff zforce zgrep zmore znew
Why is it incomplete? This really are small shell scripts, they
should fit onto the distribution disks, if not delete the useless
Coherent awk or diff, then they'll fit.
GNU cpio wasn't updated, it's still 2.1 while 2.3 is the latest release.
Hal, I don't know anymore if I gave you the archive or not, however,
the sources are on alien under /u1/gnu/src and I've not had to change
them for r09 or r10.
GNU zip, tar and cpio aren't on the GNU tools disk, because they already
are distributed with the OS, so they should be maintained on the source
box. Make sure that you upgrade this GNU stuff, newer releases aren't
just for fun!
--
fix fdisk command
Remove remacc from /etc/shadow.
Omit xdebug include from stdlib.h.
Allow update to systems with /usr et al mounted elsewhere than /dev/root.
r09 /bin/sh fd leak, fix forthcoming from Nigel.
Move date grave in /etc/brc to past fsck because pipe is used, and/or
  modify date to read /dev/cmos directly, no pipe needed.
Fix mkfs so it doesn't screw up when handed an excessive inode spec in the
  proto file, or on the command line.
Fix badscan so it doesn't write a bogus number of inodes into a proto file,
  and so it doesn't complain about SCSI devices.
Use *volatile* prn in device drivers.
Udo:  Why does RAM need to be cleared on startup?
floppy drive bug
KBBOOT thing for fred
__kdmapdisp()
newusr appends ",fred" to user line for /etc/group, even for the first user
give getDmaMem alignment waste to the sysmem pool
foo.sh:  foo.sh crash
iomap bug
ftCmd signal bug
getDmaMem configuration stuff
io multiple segv bug
Add D_DMA, D_TAPE, D_NOBRKUP, D_MP to sys/conf.h for devflag support.
Nkb drivers - come up with a usable table, even before initial ioctl.
All kb drivers - get rid of ad hoc timing loops.
Nkb drivers: do scan set 1 before reboot.

Steve: "ls -l /usr/lib/terminfo/a" shows some files 644 bin root, some
  444 bin bin, not much uniformity, in r10 filesystem.  I recommend
  cleaning it up in the distribution tree with something like
	cd /usr/lib/terminfo
	chmog 755 bin bin `find . -type d`
	chmog 644 bin bin `find . -type f`
  although you might want the latter to be 444 bin bin, who knows...
Steve: The following 5 files on r10 do NOT include changes I made for Comeau.
  hal: I have uploaded source nm.c and header stdio.h and binaries
  nm, cc0, cpp, cut to mwc!~/steve/, these 5 should be updated in r12.

/usr/bin/gzip, v 1.2.4, et al from Udo - 3/2

/etc/conf/cohmain/mkdev to ask about Cyrix upgrade cache enable.  Global
variable identifying CPU type, like the one that identifies ndp type

<sys/cyrix.h> - 3/2

qfind page fault as fixed by Louis and Steve - 2/28

Louis's provisional fix for df, to coh.386/sys5.c - 2/28

Nigel's curses bug fixes, merged by Louis.  This is provisional, because
Louis has more merging to do plus bringing Nigel, Udo, and himself into
sync with the latest version. /usr/lib/libcurses.a,
/usr/lib/ndp/libcurses.a - 2/28

Bogus  fd0: head=0 <Missing Address Mark>
when loading diskette 4 of 5 of 5-1/4" set.  Don't fully understand this
one, but the problem goes away when the first recal is replaced by a
seek to cyl 0.  (There is still another recal, which I did not change,
in case the controller is out of sync with cylinder id's.)  Changed
conf/fdc/src/fdc.c and conf/fd/src/fl386.c.

255 head fix for hai154x, recently received from Chris. Also increased
timeout in aha_hareset() to 1000 msec. 2/28

iomap fix and related changes, including addition of __kdenabio(),
__kddisabio(), __kdaddio(), and __kddelio() to the ddk.  Make i386/md.c

conf/nkb/src/nkb.c, conf/kb/src/kb.c, <sys/coherent.h>, <sys/vtkd.h> 2/28

/etc/install was still stupid about resuming failed partial installs.
Install is now a shell script, with recovery/retry, shell escapes, usw.
Also modem config stuff now merged into asy/mkdev where it belongs,
pending Steve's smart mux driver.
- changed /etc/install, /etc/install.u, /etc/conf/asy/mkdev on dalek 2/23

SEG_PWT (0x08) added to <sys/mmu.h>
- dalek updated 2/22

At end of upgrade, system hangs while running /conf/pwsetup.
- fix to /conf/pwsetup from Nigel written to dalek 2/22

Drop version printf from at driver.
- driver source changed 2/22

System does not stay in single user mode, regardless of exit status from
/etc/brc.  System does not allow users to stay logged in.  Both are due
to a bug in /etc/profile.
- dalek updated (/etc/profile, /etc/motd) 2/21

Nigel sez:

I created this directory to hold procedures that are created to wrap up
the most central system data entities such as the U area and process
structure. In order to provide a semblance of decoupling, these
routines form mid-level functional interfaces to the core system data
structures.

Each routine isolates some data item or system, and typically provides
"library-level" functionality that is expected to find wide use. Where
possible, these routines depend only on one another and on the true
system primitives such as memory allocation and multiprocessor locks.

These files have been created in an ad-hoc way, and this system is
still in an embryonic form. Except for those routines that are provided
as part of the DDI/DKI implementation, the specifications are still
somewhat fluid and the documentation non-existent, so unless something
has been stable for a while, be prepared for some tuning of the
parameters to a routine as the interfaces evolve.

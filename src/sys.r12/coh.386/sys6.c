 * A brief note, before we begin: at the time of writing, the Coherent kernel
 * is a little screwed-up w.r.t. checking validity of memory references. While
 * in a sane system the user-kernel copying routines would perform all the
 * necessary checking, apparently this is not in fact the case. Sadly, rather
 * than do the right thing there is now an additional API for this which is
 * used or not used apparently at random.
 *
 * Well, screw that. The only sane course of action is to make the user-kernel
 * copy routines do everything they need to do to cope with checking user
 * address validity; the routines below assume this, and when I rewrite all
 * the MMU stuff I'll ensure that it is so.

 *-STATUS:
 *	POSIX.1
 *
 *-NAME:
 *	sigaction ()	Detailed signal management
 *
 *-SYNOPSIS:
 *	#include <signal.h>
 *
 *	int sigaction (int sig, const struct sigaction * act,
 *		       struct sigaction * oact);
 *
 *-DESCRIPTION:
 *	sigaction () allows the calling process to examine and/or specify the
 *	action to be taken on delivery of a specific signal.
 *
 *	"sig" specifies the signal and can be assigned any of the signals
 *	specified in signal(5) except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.
 *
 *	If the argument "arg" is not NULL, it points to a structure specifying
 *	the new action to be taken when delivering "sig". If the argument
 *	"oact" is not NULL, it points to a structure where the action
 *	previously associated with "sig" is to be stored on return from
 *	sigaction ().
 *
 *	The "sigaction" structure includes the following members:
 *		void	     (*	sa_handler) ();
 *		sigset_t	sa_mask;
 *		int		sa_flags;
 *
 *	"sa_handler" specifies the disposition of the signal and may take any
 *	of the values specified in signal (5).
 *
 *	"sa_mask" specifies a set of signals to be blocked while the signal
 *	handler is active. On entry to the signal handler, that set of signals
 *	is added to the set of signals already being blocked when the signal
 *	is delivered. In addition, the signal that caused the handler to be
 *	executed will also be blocked, unless the SA_NODEFER flag has been
 *	specified. SIGSTOP and SIGKILL cannot be blocked (the system silently
 *	enforces this restriction).
 *
 *	"sa_flags" specifies a set of flags used to modify the behaviour of
 *	the signal. It is formed by a logical OR of any of the following
 *	values (only SA_CLDSTOP is available to System V, Release 3
 *	applications):
 *
 *	SA_NOCLDSTOP	If set and "sig" equals SIGCHLD, "sig" will not be
 *			sent to the calling process when its child processes
 *			stop or continue.
 *
 *	SA_NOCLDWAIT	If set and "sig" equals SIGCHLD, the system will not
 *			create zombie processes when children of the calling
 *			process exit. If the calling process subsequently
 *			issues a wait (), it blocks until all of the calling
 *			process's child processes terminate, and then returns
 *			a value of -1 with "errno" set to ECHILD.
 *
 *	SA_ONSTACK	If set and the signal is caught and an alternate
 *			signal stack has been declared with sigaltstack (),
 *			the signal is delivered to the calling process on that
 *			stack. Otherwise, the signal is delivered on the
 *			same stack as the main program.
 *
 *	SA_RESETHAND	If set and the signal is caught, the disposition of
 *			the signal is reset to SIG_DFL, and the signal will
 *			not be blocked on entry to the signal handler (SIGILL,
 *			SIGTRAP, and SIGPWR cannot be automatically reset when
 *			delivered; the system silently enforces this
 *			restriction).
 *
 *	SA_NODEFER	If set and the signal is caught, the signal will not
 *			be automatically blocked by the kernel while it is
 *			being caught.
 *
 *	SA_RESTART	If set and the signal is caught, a system call that
 *			is interrupted by the execution of this signal's
 *			handler is transparently restarted by the system.
 *			Otherwise, the system call returns an EINTR error.
 *
 *	SA_SIGINFO	If cleared and the signal is caught, "sig" is passed
 *			as the only argument to the signal-catching function.
 *			If set and the signal is caught, pending signals of
 *			type "sig" are reliably queued to the calling process
 *			and two additional arguments are passed to the signal-
 *			catching function. If the second argument is not equal
 *			to NULL, it points to a "siginfo_t" structure
 *			containing the reason why the signal was generated;
 *			the third argument points to a "ucontext_t" structure
 *			containing the receiving process's context when the
 *			signal was delivered.
 *
 *	sigaction () fails if any of the following is true:
 *
 *	EINVAL		The value of the "sig" argument is not a valid signal
 *			number or is equal to SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.
 *
 *	EFAULT		"act" or "oact" points outside the process's allocated
 *			address space.
 *
 *-DIAGNOSTICS:
 *	On success, sigaction () returns zero. On failure, it returns -1 and
 *	sets "errno" to indicate the error.

 *-SYNOPSIS:

 *	long pathconf (const char * path, int name);
 *
 *-DESCRIPTION:
 *	The functions fpathconf () and pathconf () return the current value of
 *	a configurable limit or option associated with a file or directory.
 *	The "path" argument points to the pathname of a file or directory;
 *	"fildes" is an open file descriptor; and "name" is the symbolic
 *	constant (defined in <unistd.h>) representing the configurable system
 *	limit or option to be returned.
 *
 *	The values returned by pathconf () or fpathconf () depend on the type
 *	of file specified by "path" or "fildes". The following table contains
 *	the symbolic constants supported by pathconf () and fpathconf ()
 *	along with the POSIX defined return value. The return value is based
 *	on the type of file specified by "path" or "fildes".
 *
 *	_PC_LINK_MAX	The maximum value of a file's link count. If "path" or
 *			"fildes" refers to a directory, the value returned
 *			applies to the directory itself.
 *
 *	_PC_MAX_CANON	The number of bytes in a terminal canonical input
 *			queue. The behaviour is undefined if "path" or
 *			"fildes" does not refer to a terminal file.
 *
 *	_PC_MAX_INPUT	The number of bytes for which space will be available
 *			in a terminal input queue. The behaviour is undefined 
 *			"path" or "fildes" does not refer to a terminal file.
 *
 *	_PC_NAME_MAX	The number of bytes in a filename. The behaviour is
 *			undefined if "path" or "fildes" does not refer to a
 *			directory. The value returned applies to the filenames
 *			within the directory.
 *
 *	_PC_PATH_MAX	The number of bytes in a pathname. The behaviour is
 *			undefined if "path" or "fildes" does not refer to a
 *			directory. The value returned is the maximum length of
 *			a relative pathname when the specified directory is
 *			the working directory.
 *
 *	_PC_PIPE_BUF	The number of bytes that can be written atomically
 *			when writing to a pipe. If "path" or "files" refers to
 *			a pipe or FIFO, the value returned applies to the FIFO
 *			itself. If "path" or "fildes" refers to a directory,
 *			the value returned applies to any FIFOs that exist or
 *			can be created within the directory. If "path" or
 *			"fildes" refer to any other type of file, the
 *			behaviour is undefined.
 *
 *	_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED	The use of the chown () function is restricted
 *			to a process with appropriate priveleges, and to
 *			changing the group ID of a file only to the effective
 *			group ID of the process or to one of its supplementary
 *			group IDs. If "path" or "fildes" refers to a
 *			directory, the value returned applies to any files,
 *			other than directories, that exist or can be created
 *			within the directory.
 *
 *	_PC_NO_TRUNC	Pathname components longer than NAME_MAX generate an
 *			error. The behaviour is	undefined if "path" or
 *			"fildes" does not refer to a directory. The value
 *			returned applies to the filenames within the
 *			directory.
 *	_PC_VDISABLE	Terminal special characters can be disabled using this
 *			character value, if it is defined. The behaviour is
 *			undefined if "path" or "filedes" does not refer to a
 *			terminal file.
 *
 *	The value of the configurable system limit or option specified by
 *	"name" does not change during the lifetime of the calling process.
 *
 *	fpathconf () fails if the following is true:
 *
 *	EBADF		"fildes" is not a valid file descriptor.
 *
 *	pathconf () fails if any of the following are true:
 *
 *	EACCES		Search permission is denied for a component of the
 *			path prefix.
 *
 *	ELOOP		Too many symbolic links are encountered while
 *			translating "path".
 *
 *	EMULTIHOP	Components of "path" require hopping to multiple
 *			remote machines and the file system type does not
 *			allow it.
 *
 *	ENAMETOOLONG	The length of a pathname component exceeds PATH_MAX,
 *			or a pathname component is longer than NAME_MAX while
 *			_POSIX_NO_TRUNC is in effect.
 *
 *	ENOENT		"path" is needed for the command specified and the
 *			named file does not exist or if the "path" argument
 *			points to an empty string.
 *
 *	ENOLINK		"path" points to a remote machine and the link to that
 *			machine is no longer active.
 *
 *	ENOTDIR		A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

 *-NAME:
 *	rename ()	change the name of a file
 *
 *-SYNOPSIS:
 *	#include <stdio.h>
 *
 *	int rename (const char * old, const char * new);
 *
 *-DESCRIPTION:
 *	rename () renames a file. "old" is a pointer to the pathname of the
 *	file or directory to be ranamed. "new" is a pointer to the new
 *	pathname of the file or directory. Both "old" and "new" must be of the
 *	same type (either both files, or both directories) and must reside on
 *	the same file system.
 *
 *	If "new" already exists, it is removed. Thus, if "new" names an
 *	existing directory, the directory must not have any entries other than
 *	possibly '.' and '..'. When renaming directories, the "new" pathname
 *	must not name a descendant of "old". The implementation of rename ()
 *	ensures that upon successful completion a link named "name" will
 *	always exist.
 *
 *	If the final component of "old" is a symbolic link, the symbolic link
 *	is renamed, not the file or directory to which it points.
 *
 *	Write permission is required for both the directory containing "old"
 *	and the directory containing "new".
 *
 *	rename () fails, "old" is not changed, and no "new" file is created if
 *	one or more of the following are true:
 *
 *	EACCES		A component of either path prefix denies search
 *			permission; one of the directories containing "old"
 *			or "new" denies write permission; or one of the
 *			directories pointed to by "old" or "new" denies write
 *			permission.
 *
 *	EBUSY		"new" is a directory and the mount point for a mounted
 *			filesystem.
 *
 *	EDQUOT		The directory in which the entry for the new name is
 *			being placed cannot be extended because the user's
 *			quota of disk blocks on the file system containing the
 *			directory has been exhausted.
 *
 *	EEXIST		The link named by "new" is a directory containing
 *			entries other than '.' and '..'.
 *
 *	EFAULT		"old" or "new" points outside the process's allocated
 *			address space.
 *
 *	EINVAL		"old" is a parent directory of "new", or an attempt is
 *			made to rename '.' or '..'.
 *
 *	EINTR		A signal was caught during execution of the rename ()
 *			system call.
 *
 *	EIO		An I/O error occurred while making or updating a
 *			directory entry.
 *
 *	EISDIR		"new" points to a directory by "old" points to a file
 *			that is not a directory.
 *
 *	ELOOP		Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
 *			"old" or "new".
 *
 *	EMULTIHOP	Components of pathnames require hopping to multiple
 *			remote machines and the filesystem type does not allow
 *			it.
 *
 *	ENAMETOOLONG	The length of the "old" or "new" argument exceeds
 *			{PATH_MAX}, or the length of an "old" or "new"
 *			component exceeds {NAME_MAX} while _POSIX_NO_TRUNC is
 *			in effect.
 *
 *	ENOENT		A component of either "old" or "new" does not exists,
 *			or the file referred to by either "old" or "new" does
 *			not exist.
 *
 *	ENOLINK		Pathnames point to a remote machine and the link to
 *			that machine is no longer active.
 *
 *	ENOSPC		The directory that would contain "new" is out of
 *			space.
 *
 *	ENOTDIR		A component of either path prefix is not a directory;
 *			or the "old" parameter names a directory and the "new"
 *			parameter names a file.
 *
 *	EROFS		The requested operation requires writing in a
 *			directory on a read-only file system.
 *
 *	EXDEV		The links named by "old" and "new" are on different
 *			file systems.
 *
 *-DIAGNOSTICS:
 *	Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a
 *	value of -1 is returned and "errno" is set to indicate the error.
 *
 *-NOTES:
 *	The system can deadlock if there is a loop in the file system graph.
 *	Such a loop takes the form of an entry in directory "a", say "a/foo",
 *	being a hard link to directory "b", and an entry in directory "b", say
 *	"b/bar", being a hard link to directory "a". When such a loop exists
 *	and two separate processes attempt to perform rename () "a/foo" to
 *	"b/bar" and rename () "b/bar" to "a/foo" respectively, the system may
 *	deadlock attempting to lock both directories for modification. The
 *	system administrator should replace hard links to directories with
 *	symbolic links.

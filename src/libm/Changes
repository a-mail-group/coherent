libm source change log begun 5/22/92

Fri May 22 13:15:18 1992 PDT
ceil.c
cos.c
floor.c
pow.c
tan.c
two.c
		Corrected sources to reflect corrected modf() return value
		for negative arguments; e.g. for arg -1.9,
		modf() used to return intpart -2. and fracpart .1,
		now (correctly) it returns intpart -1. and fracpart -.9.
		Other minor cosmetic changes.

Tue Jun  9 17:23:40 1992 PDT
sin.c
sinh.c
tanh.c
		Added code to return arg unchanged when less that THRESHOLD
		in absolute value after Promula reported inaccuracy for very
		small arguments.

Wed Jun 10 14:37:37 1992 PDT
sin.c
		Another change by cef: below THRESHOLD, sin(x) now uses
		Taylor's Series, rather than just returning x.

Mon Oct 26 11:09:36 1992 PST
i387/*
		Initial version.  Steve modified the existing i8087 NDP
		routines 10/19-23/92, including conversion of the old .m
		sources to current assembler format and simplification of
		many routines by using i80x87 opcodes which were not present
		in the i8087.  Appears to work, but not heavily tested.

Wed Dec  2 13:43:01 1992 PST
i387/Makefile
		Added pol.o and j[01n].o, previously missing,
		using common C sources.

Wed Jan 13 16:00:25 1993 PST
i387/acos87.s
i387/asin87.s
i387/exp87.s
i387/tanh87.s
		Change fdiv/fsub ops in keeping with cef's as change,
		for Unix compatability.

Thu Feb  4 15:07:33 1993 PST
Makefile
i387/Makefile
fmod.c
		Added fmod.c defining fmod() per ANSI 4.5.6.4 after a user
		observed that it was not there.  Updated Makefiles accordingly.

Tue May 18 07:03:19 1993 PDT
i387/atan287.s
		User Jim West <jwest@jwest.ecen.okstate.edu> reported that
		atan2(1., -1.) and atan2(-1., 1.) returned the wrong values
		with -VNDP (and thus with gcc).  He's right, the 80x87 code
		incorrectly (and unnecessarily) adjusted the fpatan return
		value.  Now it leaves the return value alone and it works.

Tue Mar  8 14:49:55 1994 PST
Makefile
i387/Makefile
		Added comments to Makefiles to clarify making.
*.c
		Added "#include <errno.h>" to sources for compilation
		with COH 4.2 header suite.  Nonsubstantive whitespace changes.
i387/*.s
		Added ".intelorder" to sources so that -f is not required.

Fri Jun 10 13:42:43 1994 PDT
Makefile
i387/Makefile
		Modified to include library object dependencies.

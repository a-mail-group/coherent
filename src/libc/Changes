i8086/i386 libc source change log, begun 1/26/94
Earlier changes are in libc/Changes.1993.

Thu Jan 27 12:25:56 1994 PST
		Resolved library differences with the V4.2.r05 distribution
		library, which was produced at MWC by nigel.  nigel
		apparently started with V4.1.40 rather than V4.1.42,
		see Changes.1993 for the differences.  The V4.1.43 library
		generated for r06 with the changes detailed below is
		recompiled from scratch with the modified sources;
		however, because Steve does not yet have the appropriate
		getopt.c source, the V4.1.43 library uses nigel's getopt.o.
*
		Extensive minor changes to many existing sources to allow
		compilation with current COH 4.2r05 headers.
		Rearranged directory structure for sanity:
		moved most stdlib functions to stdlib/,
		moved gen/malloc/ to stdlib/malloc/,
		moved gen/ctype/ to ctype/,
		moved most time functions from gen to time/.
		Modified headers accordingly.
gen/__fltused.c
		Added to resolve external "__fltused" when linking with
		objects compiled on Unix systems.
gen/clock.c
gen/difftime.c
gen/fnmatch.c
gen/mkfifo.c
gen/raise.c
		Added.
gen/ctime.c
		nigel's version, extensive whitespace changes in addition
		to substantive changes from previous source.
gen/Makefile
		Modified as per above changes.
stdio/Makefile
		Deleted rename.o, now a system call; cf. sys/i386/scall.s5.
sys/i386/setpgrp.c
		Deleted, replaced by getpgrp.c.
sys/i386/mscall.c
		Added ".unixorder" to .s output.
sys/i386/getpgrp.c
sys/i386/sigaction.s
sys/i386/sigjmp.s
		Added.
sys/i386/scall.s5
		Added new system calls fpathconf, getgroups, getmsg,
		pathconf, putmsg, rename, setgroups,
		sigpending, sigprocmask, sigsuspend, sysconf;
		all are generated automatically from scall.s5.
sys/i386/Makefile
		Modified as per above changes.
time/strftime.c
		Added.
gen/copyright.c
		V4.2.1: bumped copyright date to include 1994.

Thu Jan 27 21:20:09 1994 PST
time/strftime.c
		V4.2.2: rudimentary test program revealed that 'w' and 'W'
		formats were reversed.

Thu Feb  3 15:43:27 1994 PST
gen/getopt.c
		V4.2.3: replaced old getopt.c source with nigel's,
		cf. comments on 1/27/94 above.

Tue Feb 15 13:48:08 1994 PST
time/ctime.c
		V4.2.4: change from nigel, using namechar() to forbid '+'
		and '-' in TZ names.

Wed Feb 23 10:30:28 1994 PST
crt/i386/*.s
crt/i387/*.s
gen/i386/*.s
stdlib/i386/*.s
string/i386/*.s
		Added ".intelorder" to .s files so that making libc.a does
		not require setting ASFLAGS.
sys/i386/Makefile
		Removed ASFLAGS setting, now bogus.
		
Thu Jun  9 12:54:09 1994 PDT
copyright/Makefile
copyright/copyright.c
		Moved copyright.c from gen to new subdirectory copyright,
		which makes the Makefiles cleaner.
Makefile
*/Makefile
*/*/Makefile
		Rewrote Makefiles to use explicit library dependencies
		(which old make did not support but which now works).
		libc.a now builds without leaving any garbage whatever behind.

Thu Jun  9 13:40:16 1994 PDT
gen/Makefile
gen/getspent.c
		V4.2.5: added shadow password entry source from louis,
		modified Makefile accordingly.  Requires <shadow.h>.

Fri Jul  8 09:38:49 1994 PDT
string/strdup.c
		At udo's suggestion, modified strdup() to handle NULL arg.

Fri Jul  8 10:02:56 1994 PDT
gen/coffnlist.h
		Modified FILEHDR to FILHDR to comply with <coff.h> change.

Tue Jul 12 10:51:03 1994 PDT
gen/getlogin.c
		Nonsubstantive whitespace and #include changes.

Wed Aug  3 15:20:34 1994 PDT
time/Makefile
time/mktime.c
		V4.2.6: added mktime() from steve's source.

Tue Sep 13 15:45:55 1994 PDT
gen/Makefile
gen/drand48.c
		V4.2.7: Added source defining
		[dejlmns]rand48()/lcong48()/seed48(), as per SVID drand48(lib).
stdio/Makefile
stdio/ctermid.c
		Added source defining ctermid(), as per POSIX.1.

Fri Oct  7 09:26:39 1994 PDT
string/Makefile
string/bcmp.c
string/bcopy.c
string/bzero.c
		Added sources for bcmp(), bcopy(), bzero() for BSD
		compatability, per hal's request.

Wed Nov 30 11:21:21 1994 PST
time/ctime.c
		In scanmday(), added code to look for leading '-' for
		dst_occur field.  User trev@asstdc.com.au (Trev Roydhouse)
		reported a problem with DST conversion, using
			TIMEZONE=AEST:-600:AEDT:4.1.10:-1.1.4:2:60 
		This bug has apparently been around since V4.2.1 (1/27/94),
		when we switched from old ctime.c to an extensively revised
		source from nigel.

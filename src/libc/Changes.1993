i8086/i386 libc source change log, begun 1/4/93
Earlier changes are in libc/Changes.1992.

Mon Jan  4 16:42:19 1993 PST
gen/copyright.c
		V4.1.14: bumped copyright date to include 1993.
sys/execvpe.c
		Changed default shell DEFSHELL ("sh") to SHELL ("/bin/sh")
		to fix bug reported by vlad.

Tue Jan  5 16:29:49 1993 PST
gen/mktemp.c
		V4.1.15: rewritten after user Udo Monk reported mktemp() suffix
		caused problem when result string was used to construct a
		call to system().  Old source generated 91 distinct suffixes
		(all but control, SP, DEL, *, ?, `), the new 63 ([a-zA-Z0-9_).

Mon Jan 11 17:58:20 1993 PST
gen/getpwent.c
		V4.1.16: set pw_comment field instead of pw_gecos,
		which it previously set, to fix bug reported by Udo Monk.

Wed Jan 13 13:34:32 1993 PST
		V4.1.17: recompilation with merged NDP sources and updated
		compiler, no substantive changes.

Wed Jan 13 15:42:28 1993 PST
crt/i387/rts87.s
		V4.1.18: change fdiv/fsub ops for consistency with
		cef's assembler changes, for Unix compatability.

Mon Jan 25 16:43:03 1993 PST
gen/atof.c
gen/strtod.c
		V4.1.19: modified to ignore trailing zeros after '.'.
		Before, e.g. "2.00000000000000000" convertsion produced
		incorrect low-order bit (because scaling by 10E-n is not
		precise).

Tue Jan 26 10:15:28 1993 PST
sys/i386/wait.s
		Changes from hal to implement both wait() and waitpid().
crt/i387/rts87.s
		Added _fwait (fwait; ret) in case the user wants to
		explicitly force coprocessor synchronization.
gen/malloc/malloc.h
		Added ulimit(3) call to set upper bound on sbrk() calls.
		Also changed <sys/malloc.h> DECRSIZE from 256 to 4096.

Tue Jan 26 13:12:11 1993 PST
stdio/*
		Changed to ANSI-compliant stdio source base, with
		corresponding change to <stdio.h>, invalidating all old
		unlinked objects and libraries.

Thu Jan 28 14:33:19 1993 PST
stdio/_stropen.c
		Initialize the FILE structure for sprintf/sscanf more
		carefully.  cef discovered sscanf() bug due to failure to
		initialize the FILE flags correctly, resulting in bogus EOF.

Fri Jan 29 09:50:04 1993 PST
stdio/sprintf.c
		V4.1.21: simplified to call vsprintf().
stdio/vsprintf.c
		_FILE2 was not initialized correctly.

Fri Jan 29 11:21:10 1993 PST
stdio/_finit.c
		V4.1.22: fixed mode for unbuffered stdin input.

Mon Feb  1 15:19:30 1993 PST
sys/i386/Makefile
		V4.1.23: hal's recent wait.s change made label "done" visible;
		added -x to ASFLAGS in the make to make it disappear.

Mon Feb  8 09:42:29 1993 PST
stdio/_scanf.c
stdio/vfprintf.c
		V4.1.24: Corrected conditionalization which caused printf()
		to print all int values with 16 bits, not 32.  Fixed "%p"
		conversions to 8 hex character width.

Tue Feb  9 10:20:09 1993 PST
stdio/_fgetb.c
		V4.1.25: Corrected bug causing _fgetb() to not return EOF
		when it should.

Tue Feb  9 15:56:31 1993 PST
string/strerror.c
		V4.1.26: hal noted that error 36 should be EIDRM,
		"IPC object removed", for iBCS2,
		so strerror() (and thus perror()) changed accordingly.
		Added EDEADLK and ENOLCK messages, previously missing.

Tue Feb  9 17:01:27 1993 PST
string/strerror.c
		V4.1.27: changed message to "Identifier removed"
		at vlad's suggestion.

Wed Feb 24 09:20:30 1993 PST
sys/i386/Makefile
sys/i386/scall.s5
		V4.1.28: added chsize() system call per hal's request.

Wed Feb 24 14:54:36 1993 PST
gen/strtod.c
		V4.1.29: ".5" previously returned 0 without scanning any
		characters, now it works as expected.  DECVAX limits were
		previously wired-in, now source uses the correctly DECVAX/IEEE
		conditionalized <float.h>.

Fri Feb 26 11:16:03 1993 PST
gen/getpwent.c
		V4.1.30: set pw_gecos field in addition to pw_comment field;
		cf. change of 1/11/93 above.

Wed Mar  3 09:52:19 1993 PST
gen/ctype/isascii.c
		V4.1.31: changed <ctype.h> definition
			#define	isascii(c)	(((c)&0x80)==0)
		to
			#define	isascii(c)	(((c)&~0x7F)==0)
		and made corresponding change to isascii.c.
		This allows isascii() to work as expected for all int args;
		the previous version returned true for 256, for example.

Thu Mar 25 14:36:31 1993 PST
stdio/_dtefg.c
		V4.1.32: in _dtoa, added missing "++cp" when .999999...*10^n
		gets rounded up to 1.0 during output conversion.  The old
		code caused the code
			for (d1 = 0.; d1 < 10.; d1 += .1)
				if (d1 >= 9.9)
					printf("d1=%g\n", d1);
		to print "00" instead of "10".

Tue Apr 20 08:55:56 1993 PDT
string/strerror.c
		V4.1.33:  Trivial change requested by hal:  for EBUSY,
		message "Device busy (mount)" is now simply "Device busy".

Wed Apr 21 22:23:49 1993 PDT
stdio/fread.c
stdio/fwrite.c
		V4.1.34: fread() did not check if stream was write-only,
		fwrite() did not check if stream was read-only.

Wed Apr 21 22:44:33 1993 PDT
stdio/fread.c
stdio/fwrite.c
		V4.1.35: reversed V4.1.34 changes above, they were unnecessary.
		The real problem was not calling clearerr(fp) after a write
		to a read-only stream failed.

Fri Apr 30 10:34:20 1993 PDT
gen/getpwent.c
		V4.1.36: modified getpwent() to only accept /etc/passwd lines
		with exactly six ':'-separators.  This may invalidate some
		(presumably ill-formatted) lines in existing password files.
		/bin/passwd should be recompiled with this library to fix
		the problem reported at least a month ago, namely that someone
		ended up logged in as root without needing a password because
		of a bogus line in /etc/passwd.

Fri Jun  4 15:01:41 1993 PDT
sys/i386/Makefile
sys/i386/scall.s5
		V4.1.38: Added stub for nap() system call at hal's request.

Tue Jun 22 10:33:25 1993 PDT
sys/i386/Makefile
sys/i386/scall.s5
		V4.1.39: Added stub for ftime() system call at hal's request.

Thu Jun 24 15:37:27 1993 PDT
gen/ctime.c
		V4.1.40: conditionalized out ftime() definition with #if 0
		to avoid conflict with system call stub added in V4.1.39 above.

Tue Jul  6 11:44:13 1993 PDT
libc/string/i386/Makefile
libc/string/i386/index.s
libc/string/i386/rindex.s
libc/string/i386/strchr.s
libc/string/i386/strrchr.s
		Previously, index()/rindex() were defined as alternate
		entry points in the same object modules as strchr()/strrchr().
		Now each is in its own object module, where index.s is
		essentially just the line
			jmp strchr
		A user program which defines its own variable "index" and also
		uses strchr() now can compile and link without complaint,
		using the user program "index" and the library "strchr()."
libc/string/Makefile
libc/string/strdup.c
		V4.1.41:  Added new function strdup():
			char *strdup(s) char *s;
		strdup() returns a malloc()'ed copy of the argument s,
		or NULL if the allocation fails.

Mon Oct 25 14:15:03 1993 PDT
gen/ctime.c
		V4.1.42: in nthday(), corrected "<" to "<=" so that
		DST conversion finds the last Sunday in October correctly.
		Several users noted that COH DST conversion broke on 10/24/93,
		because 10/31/93 falls on Sunday and the code was wrong.
